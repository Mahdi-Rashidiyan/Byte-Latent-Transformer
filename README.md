# Byte-Latent-Transformer

An experimental implementation of the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) architecture, inspired by Meta AI's research on tokenizer-free large language models.

---

## üìñ Overview

The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) is a novel architecture that processes raw byte sequences directly, eliminating the need for traditional tokenization. By dynamically segmenting input data into variable-length patches based on entropy, BLT allocates computational resources more efficiently, leading to improved performance and scalability.

This repository offers a simplified implementation of the BLT model, focusing on the core concepts of dynamic patching and byte-level processing.
